My First Web Page
This is my very first static website, developed as part of my learning journey in frontend development. It was created following the teachings and project guidelines from Ceibal.
This simple static website was built using only frontend technologies:
HTML for structure.
CSS for styling.
Although it doesn't include complex functionality or a backend, this project represents my first step into web development and helped me understand the basics of building websites.
It was also my first attempt at creating a responsive layout , allowing the site to adapt to different screen sizes.
